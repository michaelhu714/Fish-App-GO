# Fish Card Game üé¥üêü

# üìñ How to Play:

Objective: Work with your team to steal your opponents' cards, figure out your teammates' hands, and score 5 sets to win.
# üèÅ Setup:
- Players: 2 teams of 3 (6 players total).
> Card Sets:
- Low Suit: 2-7 of each suit.
- High Suit: 9-A of each suit.
- Eights and Jokers: All 8s and the red/black jokers
# üéÆ Gameplay:
Turn Rules:
On your turn, you may ask an opponent for a card from a set you already hold.
Example: If you have the 2 of hearts (Low Suit), you can ask for another low heart (e.g., 3 of hearts).
IMPORTANT: You can only ask for cards from sets you already hold.
(e.g., If you only have low heart, you cannot ask for a high heart.)
Declaring a Set:
When you believe your team knows who holds all the cards in a set, you can declare.
If your declaration is correct, your team scores 1 point.
If incorrect, the point goes to your opponents.
Winning the Game:
The first team to score 5 points (sets) wins the game.
# ü§ù Strategy:
Collaborate with your teammates to deduce their hands.
Outsmart your opponents to prevent them from completing sets.
Use memory and deduction to track card movements.
